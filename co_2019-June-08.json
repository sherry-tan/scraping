In these areas, Janssen aims to address and solve unmet medical needs through the development of small and large molecules, as well as vaccines. The Janssen campus in Beerse (Belgium) has a unique ecosystem covering the complete drug development life cycle, with all capabilities from basic science to market access on one campus. The integrated environment of our campus gives our people the chance to experience many different aspects of drug development throughout their career. It has a successful track record of over sixty years of drug discovery and development and is one of the most important innovation engines of the Janssen group worldwide.",

Accessible datasets include chemical descriptions and annotations of desired and undesired biological activities for millions of small molecules across thousands of assays, and information-rich but hard-to-interpret documentation of small molecules like microscopy images or transcriptomics profiles acquired at high throughput (hundreds of thousands of profiles in each of several assays). In addition, dozens of millions of chemical reactions can be mined. The goal is the selection and design of small molecules to make and test en route to better and safer drugs for patients with unmet medical needs.",

They will demonstrate added value to drug discovery of the resulting approaches by their application to portfolio projects. The successful candidates will have their own lines of research and collaborate with pioneer external labs on approaches to unlock and combine new types of internal and external data and to learn from them. Moreover, the scientists will translate of the evolving technologies into concrete and actionable recommendations for research biologists and medicinal chemists in support of the small molecule project portfolio from hit identification to lead optimization. Finally, the scientists will interact with R&D; IT, statistics and computational chemistry colleagues to facilitate the maturation from proof-of-concept implementations that demonstrate value addition to the discovery process into robust enterprise-grade solutions that are broadly accessible by stakeholders.",
